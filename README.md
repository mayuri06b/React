#### This Repo will hold all the notes and projects that I created during my react journey


Why to Learn React ?? 
-> Software Developer  is good , is used to Build UI 
-> React is used , to manage & build complex frontend 

when should ? 
Master JavaScript , threads , DOM , 
 
- Practise a project with Fetch api 

Facebook -> phantom message problem , Ghost Message Problem 
state -> fancy name for variables 
state & UI (DOM) mein sync nahi ho raha tha 
Inconsistency of UI 

-----------------
Go in depth / use projects

Framework / Library (more Freedom)

Topics -> 
- Core React (state , UI manipulation , JSX)

- how to propagate change (hooks) usestate , use.....

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Router sikho , state management , REDUX , zustand , context api

BAAS apps -> Backend as a service -> firebase , supabase 

After React -> 


-------------
 vite / parcel are bundlers 

React -> is a library
- react-dom -> website  
- react-native -> mobile applications 


starting with the basics -> npm -> 
npx -> node package executer , create-react-app -> ek utility 
ek bohot bulky utility hai thus Vite is recommened 

can create custom build process 

Basic React Project -> setup.next.js -> deleted , logo.svg , app.test.js , app.css 
App.js , index.js  

-------------------------------------

Notes : 
Scripts in Package.json 
- start 
- build -> production time -> converted in Js 
vite is just an Bundler -> wont have node modules -> npm i / install
