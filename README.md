# React Journey 🚀

This repository contains my **notes, experiments, and projects** created while learning **React**.  

---

## 🌟 Why Learn React?  
- React is one of the most popular libraries for building modern **UI (User Interfaces)**.  
- It simplifies **managing and building complex frontends**.  
- Backed by Facebook and widely used in the industry.  

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
Before diving into React, it helps to master:  
- **JavaScript fundamentals** (ES6+, DOM, async/await, promises).  
- **Threads & Event loop** (how JS handles concurrency).  
- **DOM Manipulation** basics.  

👉 Practice building a small project using **Fetch API** before starting React.  

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts  
- **JSX** → Write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.  
- **State** → Fancy name for variables that drive the UI.  
  - Earlier Facebook faced a *ghost message problem* → UI & state were out of sync.  
- **Props** → Reusability & passing data between components.  
- **Hooks** → Manage changes & side effects.  
  - `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.  

---

## 📚 Extended Topics  
- **Routing** → React Router.  
- **State Management** → Redux, Zustand, Context API.  
- **Class-based Components** (older React style).  
- **BAAS Apps** → Firebase, Supabase (Backend as a Service).  

---

## ⚡ Tools & Ecosystem  
- **Bundlers** → Vite (recommended), Parcel, CRA (create-react-app, now bulky).  
- **React DOM** → Web apps.  
- **React Native** → Mobile apps.  
- **Next.js** → Framework for SSR & better developer experience.  

👉 Minimal React project setup usually keeps:  
- `App.js`, `index.js`  
- Removes boilerplate like `App.test.js`, `logo.svg`, `App.css` if not needed.  

---

## 🏆 Learning Mindset  
- Go in-depth by **building projects**.  
- Learning is an **ongoing process** → don’t stop at basics.  
- React is a **library** (not a full framework) → gives more freedom to design your stack.  

---

## 🚀 After React  
Once comfortable, explore:  
- **Next.js** (for production-ready apps).  
- **TypeScript** with React.  
- **Cloud services & deployment** (AWS, Vercel, Netlify).

✨ *This repo is a reflection of my continuous journey with React. Beta learning should never stop!*  

Notes : 
Scripts in Package.json 
- start 
- build -> production time -> converted in Js 
vite is just an Bundler -> wont have node modules -> npm i / install
